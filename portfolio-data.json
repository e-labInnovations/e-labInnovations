      "Hey there 👋 I'm Ashad — an engineer with a passion for building the future one line of code and circuit at a time. I specialize in electronics, embedded systems, and full-stack development, currently working as a MTS 2 at <a href=\"https://www.thoughtspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary font-semibold hover:underline\">ThoughtSpot</a>. I've built everything from smart IoT devices to full-stack projects, and I'm on a mission to blend the physical and digital worlds creatively and efficiently.",
      "I'm also the mind behind <a href=\"https://elabins.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-primary font-semibold hover:underline\">e-lab innovations</a>, a platform where innovation meets practical electronics. Whether it's a smart egg incubator or a Telegram-controlled ESP32 project, I love making tech that just works — and works well."

      "name": "Auto Billing Trolley",
      "description": "I designed an IoT-based self-billing trolley project using RFID technology. The hardware includes an ESP8266 microcontroller, EM-18 RFID reader, and OLED display. A Node.js server communicates with the hardware through WebSocket protocol, streamlining the billing process. Customers can scan product RFID tags to add items to the trolley. The server stores product details and displays the product list and total amount on a WPA app. An OLED display on the trolley shows the total amount and product count. To remove items, users press a button, and the OLED prompts a \"remove\" action. The system updates the cart accordingly. This automated trolley enhances the shopping experience by simplifying billing, reducing manual effort, and providing real-time information.",
