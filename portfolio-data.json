A Node.js server communicates with the hardware through WebSocket protocol, streamlining the billing process. Customers can scan product RFID tags to add items to the trolley. The server stores product details and displays the product list and total amount on a WPA app. An OLED display on the trolley shows the total amount and product count. To remove items, users press a button, and the OLED prompts a \"remove\" action. The system updates the cart accordingly. This automated trolley enhances the shopping experience by simplifying billing, reducing manual effort, and providing real-time information.",
